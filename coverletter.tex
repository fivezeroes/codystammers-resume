\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
Working with computers has been something of a passion to me since I was able to build my own computer in the 8\textsuperscript{th} grade, and I recently had the honor of graduating from Clemson University with a B.S. in Computer Science. Most of my experience with computers outside of school has been in personal projects to help script away many tasks and make life easier for myself and my family.

\lettersection{Why Data Driven Safety?}
I have several years experience with most of the technologies mentioned for this position, especially Python, Bash, and Linux (Debian and Ubuntu in particular) and am very interested in a position where I can use my skills professionally. I feel that it is important that I am able to contribute in a meaningful manor to the company I work for, and DDS seems like a great opportunity to do just that.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I would be a good fit for this position because I am the type of person who in my free time likes to tinker with home automation via a handful of Raspberry Pis, run custom software on my smart devices and game consoles, and maintain a small set of servers for my home lab to provide various services to family and friends - such as an ad-blocking via DNS, media and system backups and cross-platform compilation for various projects. I'm a self starter who likes to see a goal to its completion, and go above and beyond with creating a presentation that doesn't just work, but works well, and gives more than the minimum necessary to call the job done.
