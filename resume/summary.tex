I'm a new software developer currently working at Duke Energy in Charlotte, NC.

I also have personal experience managing a variety of server solutions including VMWare ESXi, Windows Server, and Redhat-based Linux server distributions on my home server cluster. 

%I'm a newly graduated computer science major from Clemson University, with a strong focus on devops and system administration. I have experience developing in multiple programming languages, including Python, C/C++, and Java, as well as configuring and maintaining various server operating systems. I am currently looking for work in software engineering, cloud development, or server administration.
